metrics-cloud
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/torproject/metrics-cloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/torproject/metrics-cloud)

This is a collection of scripts used for deploying development, testing and
production systems relating to the [Tor
Metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/) Team.

While the Tor Sysadmin Team is responsible for many of the systems that
production code is deployed on, a limited number of production hosts are also
run directly by the Metrics Team.

As far as is possible the structure of these systems mirrors standard practice
by the Tor Sysadmin Team such that we can easily migrate systems to managed
infrastructure when desire and time present themselves.
